# Module 01: Introduction & Comparative Analysis

## 1. Overview of Viral Hepatitis
Viral hepatitis is a systemic infection that predominantly affects the liver. While several viruses can cause hepatitis (e.g., CMV, EBV, HSV), "viral hepatitis" typically refers to the hepatotropic viruses: Hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E.

### General Pathophysiology
- **Inflammation**: Hepatocyte injury leading to inflammatory cell infiltration.
- **Degeneration**: Balooning degeneration and acidophilic bodies (Councilman bodies).
- **Necrosis**: Bridging necrosis or submassive necrosis in severe cases.
- **Clinical Presentation**: Often follows a pattern of Prodromal (flu-like) -> Icteric (jaundice) -> Recovery.

## 2. Comparative Table (A-E)

| Feature | Hepatitis A (HAV) | Hepatitis B (HBV) | Hepatitis C (HCV) | Hepatitis D (HDV) | Hepatitis E (HEV) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Virus Type** | RNA (Picornavirus) | **DNA** (Hepadnavirus) | RNA (Flavivirus) | RNA (Deltavirus) | RNA (Hepevirus) |
| **Transmission** | Fecal-Oral | Blood/Body Fluids | Blood/Body Fluids | Blood/Body Fluids | Fecal-Oral |
| **Incubation** | 2-6 weeks | 2-6 months | 2-22 weeks | 2-12 weeks | 2-9 weeks |
| **Chronicity?** | **No** | Yes (90% infants, 5% adults) | **Yes (50-85%)** | Yes | No (usually*) |
| **Diagnosis** | IgM anti-HAV | HBsAg, HBV DNA | anti-HCV, HCV RNA | IgM anti-HDV | IgM anti-HEV |
| **Vaccine** | Yes | Yes | **No** | Yes (HBV vaccine) | Yes (China only) |

*\*Note: HEV can be chronic in immunocompromised patients (organ transplants).*

## 3. Transmission Routes & Risk Factors

### Enteric (A, E) - "The Vowels come from the Bowels"
- Contaminated water/food.
- Poor sanitation.
- HEV special note: High mortality in **pregnant women** (up to 20%).

### Parenteral / Sexual (B, C, D)
- IV drug use.
- Needle-stick injuries.
- Vertical transmission (Mother to Child - especially B).
- Sexual contact (High for B, Low for C).

## 4. Initial Diagnostic Approach
When a patient presents with elevated ALT/AST and jaundice:
1. **Acute Panel**: Check IgM anti-HAV, HBsAg + IgM anti-HBc, and anti-HCV.
2. **History**: Travel, drug use, sexual history, family history.
3. **Physical**: Look for stigmata of chronic liver disease (spider nevi, palmar erythema) which suggests an acute-on-chronic presentation.
